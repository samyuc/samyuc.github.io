Hi! I’m Samyu (she/her). I’m a writer, organizer, and PhD student based in Los Angeles, CA. I specialize in the study of Race, Ethnicity, and Politics and Quantitative Methods in the <a href="https://polisci.ucla.edu/person/samyu-comandur/">Department of Political Science</a> at the University of California, Los Angeles. My dissertation focuses on interventions to mitigate the impacts of anti-abortion direct action, such as policing, clinic escorting, and clinic defense, and the intervention preferences of subgroups of abortion seekers that are multiply marginalized, such as women of color.
